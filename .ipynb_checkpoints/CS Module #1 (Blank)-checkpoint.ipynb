    "A programming language is -- formally -- a collection of commands, syntax rules, and instructions that humans can use to create a software program. The primary objective of most programs is to get a computer to do something that would either take people a long time or be infeasible to calculate without significant expected errors.

Even if you're not, the concepts in these computational modules are transferable; they're just as useful if you end up coding in C++ because computer science is an overarching umbrella field. Ultimately, the main differences between individual languages come down to high-level vs. low-level (don't worry about low-level, you won't run into that here) and <i>syntax</i> (the grammar of a particular language, which doesn't take long to pick up).\n",

    "By now, you've probably run into at least one Python error. It's like learning to ride a bike... you can't say you've properly done it until you've fallen off and skinned your knee!\n",
    "\n",
    "Luckily, Python is great with being specific with what caused your program to error, often narrowing the issue down to a specific line when things went wrong (called a <i>traceback</i>), but a major step to becoming a successful coder is learning to read error messages and understand what they mean.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are 5 common error messages, what they mean, and how to diagnose the root problem:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) <b>SyntaxError</b>: invalid syntax. You've messed up the \"grammar\" of a Python program! Common causes include...\n",
    "- forgetting the parentheses in a call expression\n",
    "- forgetting the colon at the end of a conditional <code>if</code>, <code>elif</code>, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2) <b>IndentationError</b>: expected an indented block. In Python, indentation is particularly important because it can change the meaning of a program. Whenever you have a block of code that falls under a statement, it must be consistently indented (usually 2 / 4 spaces, or a tab), and deviations will result in this error. Common causes include...\n",

    "- forgetting to indent the code block inside a user-defined function\n",
    "\n",

    "3) <b>IndentationError</b>: unexpected indent. As mentioned above, consistent indentation is imperative! If you indent a line inside a block by 3 spaces and the following line by 5, you'll get this error. Common causes include...\n",
    "- forgetting to indent a block of statements inside <code>if</code>, <code>for</code>, etc. properly\n",
    "- forgetting to indent the code block inside a user-defined function\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "4) <b>NameError</b>: global name '[some_variable_name]' is not defined. Python has built-in functions, which means that it automatically knows what <code>print</code> means. It doesn't know what \"hello\" means though, and will be confused by a statement that includes a previously unknown name. Common causes include...\n",
    "- not assigning a value to a variable before using it in a statement\n",
    "- misspelling a built-in function name e.g. <code>pront</code> instead of <code>print</code>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "5) <b>TypeError</b>: Can't convert [some_data_type] object to [some_other_data_type] implicitly. When you're trying to perform an unsupported operation, usually on items of different data types, Python reacts with this error e.g. \"5\" + 5 which makes no sense unless both objects are of the same type. Common causes include...\n",
